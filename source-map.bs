## Introduction

This document is a draft version of a hardened version of the Source Map v3
specification.  In its current form, it's not a defined standard and is subject to
modifications.  If you want to get involved you will find more information under
the following [Specification Repository](https://github.com/tc39/source-map).

Background {#background}
========================

The original source map format (v1) was created by Joseph Schorr for use by
Closure Inspector to enable source-level debugging of optimized JavaScript code
(although the format itself is language agnostic).  However, as the size of the
projects using the source maps expanded the verbosity of the format started to
become a problem.  The v2 [[V2Format]] was created by trading some simplicity
and flexibility to reduce the overall size of the source map. Even with the
changes made with the v2 version of the format, the source map file size was
limiting its usefulness.  The v3 format is based on suggestions made by
Pavel Podivilov (Google).

<mark>This document codifies the prior art that is Source Map v3 but is more specific
about the precise meanings of the specification.</mark>

Terminology {#terminology}
==========================

<dfn>Generated Code</dfn> is the code which is generated
by the compiler or transpiler.

<dfn>Original Source</dfn> is the source code which has not
been passed through the compiler.

<dfn>Base64 VLQ</dfn>: [[VLQ]] is a [[base64]] value, where the most significant
bit (the 6th bit) is used as the continuation bit, and the "digits" are encoded
into the string least significant first, and where the least significant bit of
the first digit is used as the sign bit.

Note: The values that can be represented by the VLQ Base64 encoded are limited to
32-bit quantities until some use case for larger values is presented.  This
means that values exceeding 32-bits are invalid and implementations may reject
them. The sign bit is counted towards the limit, but the continuation bits are not.

<dfn>Source Mapping URL</dfn> refers to the URL referencing
the location of a source map from the [=Generated code=].

<dfn>Column</dfn> is the zero-based indexed offset within a line of the
generated code.  The definition for columns in source maps can depend on
the content type.

  * For JavaScript and CSS based source maps are defined to be in
    UTF-16 code units analogous to JavaScript string indexes.  That means that
    "A" (`LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A`) measures 1 code unit, and "🔥" (`FIRE`) measures
    2 code units.
  * For WebAssembly, columns are defined as byte offsets from the beginning 
    of the binary content (and there is only one group representing a line).
  * Source maps for other content types might diverge from this.

General Goals {#general-goals}
==============================

The goals for the v3 format of Source Maps:

* Support source-level debugging allowing bidirectional mapping
* Support server-side stack trace deobfuscation

Source Map Format {#source-map-format}
======================================

The source map is a JSON document containing a top-level JSON object with the
following structure:

```json
{
  "version" : 3,
  "file": "out.js",
  "sourceRoot": "",
  "sources": ["foo.js", "bar.js"],
  "sourcesContent": [null, null],
  "names": ["src", "maps", "are", "fun"],
  "mappings": "A,AAAB;;ABCDE"
  "ignoreList": [0]
}
```

* <dfn for="json"><code>version</code></dfn> is the version field which must always be the number
    `3` as an integer. The source map may be rejected in case of a value different from `3`.
* <dfn for="json"><code>file</code></dfn> is an optional name of the generated code
    that this source map is associated with. It's not specified if this can
    be a URL, relative path name, or just a base name. As such it has a mostly informal
    character.
* <dfn for="json"><code>sourceRoot</code></dfn> is an optional source root,
    useful for relocating source files on a server or removing repeated values in
    the [=json/sources=] entry.  This value is prepended to the individual entries in the
    "source" field.
* <dfn for="json"><code>sources</code></dfn> is a list of original sources
    used by the [=json/mappings=] entry.  Each entry is either a string that is a
    (potentially relative) URL or `null` if the source name is not known.
* <dfn for="json"><code>sourcesContent</code></dfn> is an optional list
    of source content (that is the [=Original Source=]), useful when the "source"
    can't be hosted.  The contents are listed in the same order as the [=json/sources=].
    `null` may be used if some original sources should be retrieved by name.
* <dfn for="json"><code>names</code></dfn> is an optional list of symbol names which may be used by the [=json/mappings=] entry.
* <dfn for="json"><code>mappings</code></dfn> is a string with the encoded mapping data (see [[#mappings-structure]]).
* <dfn for="json"><code>ignoreList</code></dfn> is an optional list of indices of files that
    should be considered third party code, such as framework code or bundler-generated code. This
    allows developer tools to avoid code that developers likely don't want to see
    or step through, without requiring developers to configure this beforehand.
    It refers to the [=json/sources=] array and lists the indices of all the known third-party sources
    in the source map. Some browsers may also use the deprecated <code>x_google_ignoreList</code>
    field if <code>[=json/ignoreList=]</code> is not present.


A <dfn export>decoded source map</dfn> is a [=struct=] with the following fields:
<dl dfn-for="decoded source map">
  <dt><dfn>file</dfn></dt>
  <dd>A [=string=] or null.</dd>

  <dt><dfn>sources</dfn></dt>
  <dd>A [=list=] of [=decoded source|decoded sources=].</dd>

To <dfn>optionally report an error</dfn>, implementations can choose to:
- Do nothing.
- Report an error to the user, and continue processing.
- Throw an error to abort the running algorithm. ([[Infra#algorithm-control-flow]])

Mappings Structure {#mappings-structure}
----------------------------------------

The [=json/mappings=] data is broken down as follows:

- each group representing a line in the generated file is separated by a semicolon (`;`)
- each segment is separated by a comma (`,`)
- each segment is made up of 1, 4, or 5 variable length fields.

The fields in each segment are:

1. The zero-based starting [=column=] of the line in the generated code that the segment represents.
    If this is the first field of the first segment, or the first segment following a new generated
    line (`;`), then this field holds the whole [=Base64 VLQ=].  Otherwise, this field contains
    a [=Base64 VLQ=] that is relative to the previous occurrence of this field.  <em>Note that this
    is different than the fields below because the previous value is reset after every generated line.</em>

2. If present, a zero-based index into the [=json/sources=] list. This field is a [=Base64 VLQ=]
    relative to the previous occurrence of this field, unless this is the first occurrence of this
    field, in which case the whole value is represented.

3. If present, the zero-based starting line in the original source is represented.  This field is a
    [=Base64 VLQ=] relative to the previous occurrence of this field, unless this is the first
    occurrence of this field, in which case the whole value is represented.  Always present if there
    is a source field.

4. If present, the zero-based starting [=column=] of the line in the source represented. This
    field is a [=Base64 VLQ=] relative to the previous occurrence of this field unless this
    is the first occurrence of this field, in which case the whole value is represented.  Always
    present if there is a source field.

5. If present, the zero-based index into the [=json/names=] list associated with this segment. This
    field is a base 64 VLQ relative to the previous occurrence of this field unless this
    is the first occurrence of this field, in which case the whole value is represented.

Note: The purpose of this encoding is to reduce the source map size. VLQ encoding reduced source maps by 50% relative to the [[V2Format]] in tests performed
using Google Calendar.

Note: Segments with one field are intended to represent generated code that is unmapped because there
is no corresponding original source code, such as code that is generated by a compiler. Segments
with four fields represent mapped code where a corresponding name does not exist. Segments with five
fields represent mapped code that also has a mapped name.

Note: Using file offsets was considered but rejected in favor of using line/column data to avoid becoming
misaligned with the original due to platform-specific line endings.

A <dfn>decoded mapping</dfn> is a [=struct=] with the following fields:
<dl dfn-for="decoded mapping">
  <dt><dfn>generatedLine</dfn></dt>
  <dd>A non-negative integer.</dd>

  <dt><dfn>generatedColumn</dfn></dt>
  <dd>A non-negative integer.</dd>

  <dt><dfn>originalSource</dfn></dt>
  <dd>A [=decoded source=] or null.</dd>

  <dt><dfn>originalLine</dfn></dt>
  <dd>A non-negative integer or null.</dd>

  <dt><dfn>originalColumn</dfn></dt>
  <dd>A non-negative integer or null.</dd>

  <dt><dfn>name</dfn></dt>
  <dd>A [=string=] or null.</dd>
</dl>


To <dfn>decode source map mappings</dfn> given a [=string=]
<dfn for="decode source map mappings">|mappings|</dfn>, a [=list=] of [=strings=]
<dfn for="decode source map mappings">|names|</dfn>, and a [=list=] of [=decoded source|decoded
sources=] <dfn for="decode source map mappings">|sources|</dfn>, run the following steps:
1. If |mappings| is not an [=ASCII string=], throw an error.
1. If |mappings| contains any [=code unit=] other than:
    - U+002C (,) or U+003B (;);
    - U+0030 (0) to U+0039 (9);
    - U+0041 (A) to U+005A (Z);
    - U+0061 (a) to U+007A (z);
    - U+002B (+), U+002F (/)

    NOTE: These are the valid [[base64]] characters (excluding the padding character `=`), together
    with `,` and `;`.

    then throw an error.
1. Let |decodedMappings| be a new empty [=list=].
1. Let |groups| be the result of [=strictly split|strictly splitting=] |mappings| on `;`.

            |groups|[|generatedLine|] on `,`.
        1. Let |generatedColumn| be 0.

            1. Let |position| be a [=position variable=] for |segment|, initially pointing at
                |segment|'s start.
            1. [=Decode a base64 VLQ=] from |segment| given |position| and let
                |relativeGeneratedColumn| be the result.
            1. If |relativeGeneratedColumn| is null, [=optionally report an error=] and continue
                with the next iteration.
            1. Increase |generatedColumn| by |relativeGeneratedColumn|. If the result is negative,
                [=optionally report an error=] and continue with the next iteration.
            1. Let |decodedMapping| be a new [=decoded mapping=] whose
                [=decoded mapping/generatedLine=] is |generatedLine|,

                [=decoded mapping/originalLine=] is null,
                [=decoded mapping/originalColumn=] is null,
                and [=decoded mapping/name=] is null.
            1. Append |decodedMapping| to |decodedMappings|.
            1. [=Decode a base64 VLQ=] from |segment| given |position| and let |relativeSourceIndex|
                be the result.
            1. [=Decode a base64 VLQ=] from |segment| given |position| and let
                |relativeOriginalLine| be the result.
            1. [=Decode a base64 VLQ=] from |segment| given |position| and let
                |relativeOriginalColumn| be the result.
            1. If |relativeOriginalColumn| is null, then:
                1. If |relativeSourceIndex| is not null, [=optionally report an error=].
                1. Continue with the next iteration.
            <!-- TODO: If there is a relativeSourceIndex but not a relativeOriginalLine,
                 should |sourceIndex| still be increased? -->
            1. Increase |sourceIndex| by |relativeSourceIndex|.
            1. Increase |originalLine| by |relativeOriginalLine|.
            1. Increase |originalColumn| by |relativeOriginalColumn|.
            1. If any of |sourceIndex|, |originalLine|, or |originalColumn| are less than 0, or if
                |sourceIndex| is greater than or equal to |sources|'s [=list/size=], [=optionally
                report an error=].
            1. Else,
                1. Set |decodedMapping|'s [=decoded mapping/originalSource=] to
                    |sources|[|sourceIndex|].
                1. Set |decodedMapping|'s [=decoded mapping/originalLine=] to |originalLine|.
                1. Set |decodedMapping|'s [=decoded mapping/originalColumn=] to |originalColumn|.
            1. [=Decode a base64 VLQ=] from |segment| given |position| and let |relativeNameIndex|
                be the result.
            1. If |relativeNameIndex| is not null, then:

                error=].
    1. Increase |generatedLine| by 1.
1. Return |decodedMappings|.

To <dfn>decode a base64 VLQ</dfn> from a [=string=] |segment| given a [=position variable=]
|position|, run the following steps:
1. If |position| points to the end of |segment|, return null.
1. Let |first| be a [=byte=] whose the [=byte/value=] is the number corresponding to |segment|'s
    |position|th [=code unit=], according to the [[base64]] encoding.

    NOTE: The two most significant bits of |first| are 0.
1. Let |sign| be 1 if |first| & 0x01 is 0x00, and -1 otherwise.
1. Let |value| be (|first| &gt;&gt; 1) & 0x0F, as a number.
1. Let |nextShift| be 16.
1. Let |currentByte| be |first|.
1. While |currentByte| & 0x20 is 0x20:
    1. Advance |position| by 1.
    1. If |position| points to the end of |segment|, throw an error.
    1. Set |currentByte| to the [=byte=] whose the [=byte/value=] is the number corresponding to
        |segment|'s |position|th [=code unit=], according to the [[base64]] encoding.
    1. Let |chunk| be |currentByte| & 0x1F, as a number.
    1. Add |chunk| * |nextShift| to |value|.
    1. If |value| is greater than or equal to 2<sup>31</sup>, throw an error.
    1. Multiply |nextShift| by 32.
1. Advance |position| by 1.
1. If |value| is 0 and |sign| is -1, return -2147483648.

    NOTE: -2147483648 is the smallest 32-bit signed integer.
1. Return |value| * |sign|.

NOTE: In addition to returning the decoded value, this algorithm updates the [=position variable=]
in the calling algorithm.

Resolving Sources {#resolving-sources}
--------------------------------------

If the sources are not absolute URLs after prepending the [=json/sourceRoot=], the sources are
resolved relative to the SourceMap (like resolving the script `src` attribute in an HTML document).

To <dfn>decode source map sources</dfn> given a [=/URL=] |baseURL|,
a [=string=] or null <dfn for="decode source map sources">|sourceRoot|</dfn>,
a [=list=] of either [=strings=] or nulls <dfn for="decode source map sources">|sources|</dfn>,
a [=list=] of either [=strings=] or nulls <dfn for="decode source map sources">|sourcesContent|</dfn>,
and a [=list=] of numbers <dfn for="decode source map sources">|ignoredSources|</dfn>,
run the following steps:
1. Let |decodedSources| be a new empty [=list=].
1. Let |sourceURLPrefix| be "".
1. If |sourceRoot| is not null, then:
    1. If |sourceRoot| contains the code point U+002F (/), then:
        1. Let |index| be the index of the last occurrence of U+002F (/) in |sourceRoot|.
        1. Set |sourceURLPrefix| to the [=code unit substring|substring=] of |sourceRoot| from 0 to
            |index| + 1.
    1. Else, set |sourceURLPrefix| to the concatenation of |sourceRoot| and "/".
1. [=For each=] |source| of |sources| with index |index|:
    1. Let |decodedSource| be a new [=decoded source=] whose [=decoded source/URL=] is null,
        [=decoded source/content=] is null, and [=decoded source/ignored=] is false.
    1. If |source| is not null:
        1. Set |source| to the [=string/concatenate|concatenation=] of |sourceURLPrefix| and |source|.
        1. Let |sourceURL| be the result of [=URL parser|URL parsing=] |source| with |baseURL|.
        1. If |sourceURL| is failure, [=optionally report an error=].
        1. Else, set |decodedSource|'s [=decoded source/URL=] to |sourceURL|.
    1. If |index| is in |ignoredSources|, set |decodedSource|'s [=decoded source/ignored=] to true.
    1. If |sourcesContent|'s [=list/size=] is greater than or equal to |index|, set
        |decodedSource|'s [=decoded source/content=] to |sourcesContent|[|index|].
    1. [=list/Append=] |decodedSource| to |decodedSources|.
1. Return |decodedSources|.

NOTE: Implementations that support showing source contents but do not support showing multiple
sources with the same URL and different content will arbitrarily choose one of the various contents
corresponding to the given URL.

Extensions {#extensions}
------------------------

Source map consumers must ignore any additional unrecognized properties, rather than causing the
source map to be rejected, so that additional features can be added to this format without
breaking existing users.

Index Map
=========

To support concatenating generated code and other common post-processing,
an alternate representation of a map is supported:

```json
{
  "version" : 3,
  "file": "app.js",
  "sections": [
    {
      "offset": {"line": 0, "column": 0},
      "map": {
        "version" : 3,
        "file": "section.js",
        "sources": ["foo.js", "bar.js"],
        "names": ["src", "maps", "are", "fun"],
        "mappings": "AAAA,E;;ABCDE"
      }
    },
    {
      "offset": {"line": 100, "column": 10},
      "map": {
        "version" : 3,
        "file": "another_section.js",
        "sources": ["more.js"],
        "names": ["more", "is", "better"],
        "mappings": "AAAA,E;AACA,C;ABCDE"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The index map follows the form of the standard map.  Like the regular source map,
the file format is JSON with a top-level object.  It shares the [=json/version=] and
[=json/file=] field from the regular source map, but gains a new [=sections=] field.

<dfn><code>sections</code></dfn> is an array of [=Section=] objects.

## Section

Section objects have the following fields:

* <dfn><code>offset</code></dfn> is an object with two fields, `line` and `column`,
    that represent the offset into generated code that the referenced source map
    represents.

* <dfn><code>map</code></dfn> is an embedded complete source map object.
    An embedded map does not inherit any values from the containing index map.

The sections must be sorted by starting position and the represented sections
must not overlap.

Conventions {#conventions}
==========================

The following conventions should be followed when working with source maps or
when generating them.

Source Map Naming {#source-map-naming}
--------------------------------------

Commonly, a source map will have the same name as the generated file but with a `.map`
extension.  For example, for `page.js` a source map named `page.js.map` would be generated. 

Linking generated code to source maps {#linking-generated-code}
---------------------------------------------------------------

While the source map format is intended to be language and platform agnostic, it is useful
to have some conventions for the expected use-case of web server-hosted JavaScript.

There are two suggested ways to link source maps to the output.  The first requires server
support in order to add an HTTP header and the second requires an annotation in the source.

Source maps are linked through URLs as defined in [[URL]]; in particular,
characters outside the set permitted to appear in URIs must be percent-encoded
and it may be a data URI.  Using a data URI along with [=json/sourcesContent=] allows
for a completely self-contained source map.

<ins>The HTTP `sourcemap` header has precedence over a source annotation, and if both are present,
the header URL should be used to resolve the source map file.</ins>

Regardless of the method used to retrieve the [=Source Mapping URL=] the same
process is used to resolve it, which is as follows:

When the [=Source Mapping URL=] is not absolute, then it is relative to the generated code's
<dfn>source origin</dfn>. The [=source origin=] is determined by one of the following cases:

- If the generated source is not associated with a script element that has a `src`
    attribute and there exists a `//# sourceURL` comment in the generated code, that
    comment should be used to determine the [=source origin=]. Note: Previously, this was
    `//@ sourceURL`, as with `//@ sourceMappingURL`, it is reasonable to accept both
    but `//#` is preferred.

- If the generated code is associated with a script element and the script element has
    a `src` attribute, the `src` attribute of the script element will be the [=source origin=].

- If the generated code is associated with a script element and the script element does
    not have a `src` attribute, then the [=source origin=] will be the page's origin.

- If the generated code is being evaluated as a string with the `eval()` function or
    via `new Function()`, then the [=source origin=] will be the page's origin.

### Linking through HTTP headers

If a file is served through HTTP(S) with a `sourcemap` header, the value of the header is
the URL of the linked source map.

```
sourcemap: <url>
```

Note: Previous revisions of this document recommended a header name of `x-sourcemap`.  This
is now deprecated; `sourcemap` is now expected.

### Linking through inline annotations

The generated code should include a comment, or the equivalent construct depending on its
language or format, named `sourceMappingURL` and that contains the URL of the source map. This
specification defines how the comment should look like for JavaScript, CSS, and WebAssembly.
Other languages should follow a similar convention.

For a given language there can be multiple ways of detecting the `sourceMappingURL` comment,
to allow for different implementations to choose what is less complex for them. The generated
code <dfn>unambiguously links to a source map</dfn> if the result of all the extraction methods
is the same.

If a tool consumes one or more source files that [=unambiguously links to a source map=] and it
produces an output file that links to a source map, it must do so [=unambiguously links to a
source map|unambiguously=].

<div class="example">
The following JavaScript code links to a source map, but it does not do so [=unambiguously links
to a source map|unambiguously=]:

```js
let a = `
//# sourceMappingURL=foo.js.map
//`;
```

Extracing a Source Map URL from it [=extract a Source Map URL from JavaScript through
parsing|through parsing=] gives null, while [=extract a Source Map URL from JavaScript
without parsing|without parsing=] gives `foo.js.map`.

</div>

#### Extraction methods for JavaScript sources

To <dfn export>extract a Source Map URL from JavaScript through parsing</dfn> a [=string=] |source|,
run the following steps:

1. Let |tokens| be the [=list=] of [=tokens=]
    obtained by parsing |source| according to [[ECMA-262]].
1. [=For each=] |token| in |tokens|, in reverse order:
    1. If |token| is not a [=single-line comment=] or a [=multi-line comment=], return null.
    1. Let |comment| be the content of |token|.
    1. If [=match a Source Map URL in a comment|matching a Source Map URL in=]
        |comment| returns a [=string=], return it.
1. Return null.

To <dfn export>extract a Source Map URL from JavaScript without parsing</dfn> a [=string=] |source|,
run the following steps:

1. Let |lines| be the result of [=strictly split|strictly splitting=] |source| on [=line
    terminator code points|ECMAScript line terminator code points=].
1. Let |lastURL| be null.
1. [=For each=] |line| in |lines|:
    1. Let |position| be a [=position variable=] for |line|, initially pointing at the start of |line|.
    1. [=While=] |position| doesn't point past the end of |line|:
        1. [=Collect a sequence of code points=] that are [=white space code points|ECMAScript
            white space code points=] from |line| given |position|.

            NOTE: The collected code points are not used, but |position| is still updated.
        1. If |position| points past the end of |line|, [=break=].
        1. Let |first| be the [=code point=] of |line| at |position|.
        1. Increment |position| by 1.
        1. If |first| is U+002F (/) and |position| does not point past the end of |line|, then:
            1. Let |second| be the [=code point=] of |line| at |position|.
            1. Increment |position| by 1.
            1. If |second| is U+002F (/), then:
                1. Let |comment| be the [=code point substring=] from |position| to the end of |line|.
                1. If [=match a Source Map URL in a comment|matching a Source Map URL in=]
                    |comment| returns a [=string=], set |lastURL| to it.
                1. [=Break=].
            1. Else if |second| is U+002A (*), then:
                1. Let |comment| be the empty [=string=].
                1. While |position| + 1 doesn't point past the end of |line|:
                    1. Let |c1| be the [=code point=] of |line| at |position|.
                    1. Increment |position| by 1.
                    1. Let |c2| be the [=code point=] of |line| at |position|.
                    1. If |c1| is U+002A (*) and |c2| is U+002F (/), then:
                        1. If [=match a Source Map URL in a comment|matching a Source Map URL in=]
                            |comment| returns a [=string=], set |lastURL| to it.
                        1. Increment |position| by 1.
                    1. Append |c1| to |comment|.
            1. Else, set |lastURL| to null.
        1. Else, set |lastURL| to null.

          Note: We reset |lastURL| to null whenever we find a non-comment code character.
1. Return |lastURL|.

NOTE: The algorithm above has been designed so that the source lines can be iterated in reverse order,
returning early after scanning through a line that contains a `sourceMappingURL` comment.

<div class="note">
<span class="marker">Note:</span> The algorithm above is equivalent to the following JavaScript implementation:

```js
const JS_NEWLINE = /^/m;

// This RegExp will always match one of the following:
// - single-line comments
// - "single-line" multi-line comments
// - unclosed multi-line comments
// - just trailing whitespaces
// - a code character
// The loop below differentiates between all these cases.
const JS_COMMENT =
  /\s*(?:\/\/(?<single>.*)|\/\*(?<multi>.*?)\*\/|\/\*.*|$|(?<code>[^\/]+))/uym;

const PATTERN = /^[@#]\s*sourceMappingURL=(\S*?)\s*$/;

let lastURL = null;
for (const line of source.split(JS_NEWLINE)) {
  JS_COMMENT.lastIndex = 0;
  while (JS_COMMENT.lastIndex < line.length) {
    let commentMatch = JS_COMMENT.exec(line).groups;
    let comment = commentMatch.single ?? commentMatch.multi;
    if (comment != null) {
      let match = PATTERN.exec(comment);
      if (match !== null) lastURL = match[1];
    } else if (commentMatch.code != null) {
      lastURL = null;
    } else {
      // We found either trailing whitespaces or an unclosed comment.
      // Assert: JS_COMMENT.lastIndex === line.length
    }
  }
}
return lastURL;
```

</div>

To <dfn>match a Source Map URL in a comment</dfn> |comment| (a [=string=]), run the following steps:

1. Let |pattern| be the regular expression `/^[@#]\s*sourceMappingURL=(\S*?)\s*$/`.
1. Let |match| be ! [=RegExpBuiltInExec=](|pattern|, |comment|).
1. If |match| is not null, return |match|[1].
1. Return null.


Note: The prefix for this annotation was initially `//@` however this conflicts with Internet
Explorer's Conditional Compilation and was changed to `//#`.

Source map generators must only emit `//#` while source map consumers must accept both `//@` and `//#`.

#### Extraction methods for CSS sources

Extracting source mapping URLs from CSS is similar to JavaScript, with the exception that CSS only
supports `/* ... */`-style comments.

#### Extraction methods for WebAssembly binaries

To <dfn export>extract a Source Map URL from a WebAssembly source</dfn> given
a [=byte sequence=] |bytes|, run the following steps:

1. Let |module| be [=module_decode=](|bytes|).
1. If |module| is error, return null.
1. [=For each=] [=custom section=] |customSection| of |module|,
    1. Let |name| be the `name` of |customSection|, [=UTF-8 decode without BOM or fail|decoded as UTF-8=].
    1. If |name| is "sourceMappingURL", then:
        1. Let |value| be the `bytes` of |customSection|, [=UTF-8 decode without BOM or fail|decoded as UTF-8=].
        1. If |value| is failure, return null.
        1. Return |value|.
1. Return null.

Since WebAssembly is not a textual format and it does not support comments, it supports a single unambiguous extraction method.
The URL is encoded using [[WasmNamesBinaryFormat]], and it's placed as the content of the [=custom section=]. It is invalid for
tools that generate WebAssembly code to generate two or more [=custom section|custom sections=] with the "sourceMappingURL" name.

Linking eval'd code to named generated code
-------------------------------------------

There is an existing convention that should be supported for the use of source maps with
eval'd code, it has the following form:

```
//# sourceURL=foo.js
```

It is described in [[EvalSourceURL]].

Language Neutral Stack Mapping Notes
====================================

Stack tracing mapping without knowledge of the source language is not covered by this document.

Multi-level Mapping Notes
=========================

It is getting more common to have tools generate sources from some DSL (templates) or compile
TypeScript -> JavaScript -> minified JavaScript, resulting in multiple translations before the
final source map is created.  This problem can be handled in one of two ways.  The easy but
lossy way is to ignore the intermediate steps in the process for the purposes of debugging,
the source location information from the translation is either ignored (the intermediate
translation is considered the “Original Source”) or the source location information is carried
through (the intermediate translation hidden).  The more complete way is to support multiple
levels of mapping: if the Original Source also has a source map reference, the user is given
the choice of using that as well.

However, It is unclear what a "source map reference" looks like in anything other than JavaScript.
More specifically, what a source map reference looks like in a language that doesn't support
JavaScript-style single-line comments.

Fetching Source Maps {#fetching-source-maps}
============================================

To fetch a source map given a [=/URL=] |url|, run the following steps:

1. Let |promise| be [=a new promise=].
1. Let |request| be a new [=request=] whose [=request/URL=] is |url|.
1. [=Fetch=] |request| with [=processResponseConsumeBody=] set to the following steps given [=response=] <var ignore>response</var> and null, failure, or a [=byte sequence=] |bodyBytes|:
    1. If |bodyBytes| is null or failure, [=reject=] |promise| with a {{TypeError}} and abort these steps.
    1. If |url|'s [=url/scheme=] is an [=HTTP(S) scheme=] and |bodyBytes| [=byte sequence/starts with=] \`<code>)]}'</code>\`, then:
        1. [=While=] |bodyBytes|'s [=byte sequence/length=] is not 0 and |bodyBytes|'s 0th byte is not an [=HTTP newline byte=]:
            1. remove the 0th byte from |bodyBytes|.

            <div class="note">
            <span class="marker">Note:</span> For historic reasons, when delivering source maps over HTTP(S), servers may prepend a line
            starting with the string `)]}'` to the source map.

            ```
            )]}'garbage here
            {"version": 3, ...}
            ```

            is interpreted as

            ```
            {"version": 3, ...}
            ```
            </div>
    1. Let |sourceMap| be the result of [=parsing JSON bytes to a JavaScript value=] given |bodyBytes|.
    1. If the previous step threw an error, [=reject=] |promise| with that error.
    1. Otherwise, [=resolve=] |promise| with |sourceMap|.
1. Return |promise|.
